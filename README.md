# Real Time Vechile Detection(Author: Diwas Pandey)

This is a simple vehicle detection project using Computer Vision..

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and some morphological transformation for accuracy.
But this is for only static cameras. 

At the corner of the video you can see the count of the vehicles which gets recorded
when they cross a predefined limit. For the calculation of the object coordinates and object ids I defined a class called vehicles.py

1. Just download the repository and unzip the file. <br>
2. Run the python program named <b> <i>  "main.py" </i> </b> <br>
3. Enjoy the Vechile Count Program
